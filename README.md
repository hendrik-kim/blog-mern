### Development

#### Running the Project Locally

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hendrik-kim/blog-mern.git

2. **Navigate into the Cloned Repository:**  
   ```bash
   cd blog-mern

3. **Install Dependencies in the Root Directory:**  
   Navigate to the root directory and run the following command to install all required dependencies for the backend.  
   ```bash
   npm install

4. **Install Dependencies in the Frontend Directory:**  
   Navigate to the `frontend` folder and run the following command to install all required dependencies for the frontend.  
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install

5. **Run Both Backend and Frontend:**  
   Move back to the root directory and execute the following command to run both the frontend and backend concurrently.  
   ```bash
   cd ..
   npm run dev

This will start both the frontend and backend services. Your frontend will be served at `http://localhost:3000` and your backend API can be accessed at `http://localhost:5000`.
